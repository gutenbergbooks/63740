<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>We have been lately invited to sign a parochial remonstrance
against some projected changes in the business of the London Post
Office.&nbsp; I, for one, declined the invitation.&nbsp; I never
thought of obtruding upon others my <i>reasons</i> for this
refusal.&nbsp; I am not the Minister of the Parish; nor have my
opinions, therefore, on such a subject, any particular claim on
the attention of my neighbours.</p>
<p>You know the circumstance which now compels me to explain
myself.&nbsp; I regret the necessity.&nbsp; But neither I, nor
those <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>who
have agreed with me on this occasion, can listen in silence to
the imputation of being indifferent to the national observance of
the Sunday.&nbsp; If I can show you that we are not justly liable
to this suspicion, it is well worth while to do so.&nbsp; If I
fail to convince you, I shall at least have entered a serious
protest, for myself and them, against such an imputation.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly examined the original minute (submitted by
Mr. Rowland Hill to the Post Master General in February last)
which formed the basis of the late alteration in the Sunday
duties of the Post Office.&nbsp; I could wish that that minute
had been more generally studied by those who have pronounced a
judgment upon the question.&nbsp; It is open to your inspection:
you may form, therefore, your own opinion upon the justice of the
following observations.</p>
<p>The measure now impugned (the transmission, namely, of certain
provincial and foreign letters through London on the Sunday) is
not an isolated one.&nbsp; It is but one part of a more general
scheme.&nbsp; And what is <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the object of that scheme, as
described in the minute referred to? <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; <i>The reduction
of the Sunday duties of the Post Office</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
securing of the utmost possible amount of Sunday rest to all
connected with the Post Office</i>.&nbsp; What, again, was the
first part of the same measure?&nbsp; What was that earlier step,
taken by the same persons in the same direction, of which the
present change is a consequence?&nbsp; <i>The total suspension of
all money-order business on Sunday throughout England and
Wales</i>.&nbsp; And what are some of those <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>ulterior
measures, to which the attention of the originators of this is
next to be directed?&nbsp; <i>The deferring of work now done on
the Sunday till after midnight</i>. <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; <i>The
reduction of Sunday work</i>, <i>even at the chief Office</i>,
<i>considerably below its present amount</i>. <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; <i>Important measures of relief
to the rural messengers and rural receivers on the Sunday</i>. <a
name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c"
class="citation">[6c]</a>&nbsp; What, finally, is the declared
object of the <i>present</i> alteration?&nbsp; <i>Further relief
from Sunday labour in the provincial Post Offices</i>; <i>and
thus</i>, <i>the diminution of Sunday work in the department as a
whole</i>.&nbsp; So far from its being correct to state this as a
merely accidental result of the measure, it is its very object
and purpose, to which all else is subordinate and subsidiary.</p>
<p>Ought not these considerations to preclude at least a
precipitate sentence of condemnation?&nbsp; May we not be
permitted to learn the object of a measure from its author?&nbsp;
Are we justified in imputing to any man, I do not say, motives
which he disavows, but motives of which he professes the very
opposite, and against <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>which his own previous and subsequent
acts obviously militate?</p>
<p>But the change, however well meant, may be practically
injurious.&nbsp; It may cause more harm than it obviates.&nbsp;
It may introduce more Sunday labour than it supersedes.&nbsp;
This is, of course, conceivable.&nbsp; It is just possible,
doubtless, that an able and experienced officer of this
department of the Government may be found, on this one occasion,
so unskilful or so short-sighted, as to have effected, not
<i>less</i> than he proposed, but the very <i>opposite</i> of
that which he designed.&nbsp; But is it so?</p>
<p>It is admitted that, at first sight, the alteration in
question may seem to <i>increase</i> the Sunday duties of the
Post Office.&nbsp; In London, to a certain extent, it does.&nbsp;
It will require, at the outset, the additional attendance of
twenty-five persons (hereafter, possibly, of a somewhat larger
number) on Sunday in the London Post Office. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; That attendance, you will observe
is <i>voluntary</i>.&nbsp; Nor is it allowed, in any case, to
infringe upon the hours of divine service.&nbsp; It <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>is proposed
that the whole interval from ten in the morning till five in the
afternoon be left perfectly free. <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; Nor yet would
it be correct to represent the alteration as involving any change
of <i>principle</i>.&nbsp; The attendance and employment of
<i>certain</i> persons, the reception and assortment of
<i>certain</i> letters, on the Sunday, even in the London Post
Office, is no new thing. <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; The conscience
of the Christian community has left <i>these</i> practices
unchallenged and unnoticed until now.&nbsp; Such considerations
ought to have some weight in our estimate of the present
innovation.&nbsp; Still, so far as it goes, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and taken
alone, the augmentation of the Sunday force in the London Post
Office is admitted to be an evil.&nbsp; Is it counterbalanced by
any greater good?</p>
<p>It is necessary to take a <i>national</i> view of such a
question.&nbsp; The Post Office system throughout England is one,
not many.&nbsp; The London Office, and the provincial Offices,
are but several parts of one connected whole.&nbsp; The question,
therefore, is, not whether this Office, or that Office,
separately regarded, will be a gainer or a loser by the change;
but whether, on the whole, the <i>aggregate</i> of gain or of
loss will preponderate; whether, so to say, the Post Office of
<i>England</i>, as distinguished from that of London separately,
or that of York or of Manchester separately, will thus be
relieved on the Sunday, or burdened.&nbsp; If twenty-five
<i>additional</i> servants are required in the <i>London</i>
Office on the Sunday, and <i>twice</i> twenty-five can be
<i>relieved</i> on that day in the <i>provincial</i> Offices; the
change, so far as it extends, is salutary.&nbsp; Now, if this
obvious principle be granted, the question is decided at
once.&nbsp; Beyond all contradiction, <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the present measure is one of relief
from Sunday labour to the department <i>as a whole</i>.&nbsp; But
the opponents of the measure argue thus: Taking the London Office
by itself, an <i>addition</i> is proposed to the labours of the
Sunday: this is a sinful project: and if it be urged, on the
other side, that a tenfold <i>relief</i> will thus be afforded to
the <i>provincial</i> Offices, they answer, that this is but
<i>doing evil that good may come</i>.&nbsp; Yet is not this
argument capable of an easy inversion?&nbsp; Are you not, in
<i>resisting</i> the proposed relief of the country Offices, on
the plea of regard for that of London, doing, in fact, a great
evil&mdash;not that a small good may come, but that a small evil
may not come?</p>
<p>What, then, are some of the advantages (speaking merely with
reference to the observance of the Sunday) by which this admitted
evil is counterbalanced?&nbsp; I will enumerate three only.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The cessation of several Sunday cross-posts, by which
the detention of letters in London throughout that day has been
hitherto evaded or obviated: <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> and this, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>without any
addition to the existing number of mail-trains, or other means of
transmission, to or from London, on the Sunday. <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A great diminution of the former amount of letters
written and read in the country on that day. <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>3.&nbsp; The entire discontinuance of a second delivery
of letters on Sunday throughout England and Wales: <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> a measure affecting considerably more
than two hundred Towns, and affording direct and immediate relief
to a very far larger number of persons.</p>
<p>Nor is it, perhaps, altogether presumptuous to express a hope
that the unrestricted <i>transmission</i> of letters on the
Sunday may eventually be followed by an equally general
<i>suspension</i> of their <i>delivery</i>; by which London and
the country would be placed, in this respect, on a footing of
perfect <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>equality; the due observance of the Sunday being alike
in both secured, with no injurious consequences, in either, to
the business of the following day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is ascertained that, by the alterations already
effected, a very large body (amounting to some hundreds at least)
of persons now occupied on the Sunday in the provincial Offices,
even during the hours of public worship, will be enabled to
obtain rest on that day, and to enjoy without interruption the
benefit of its religious services. <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; The number of
principal Post Offices thus benefited, in a greater or less
degree,&mdash;some to the extent of <i>seven hours</i> of
additional suspension of business on every Sunday,&mdash;amounts
very nearly to <i>five hundred</i>.&nbsp; A very far larger
number, at present imperfectly ascertained, of Sub-offices
throughout the country, will partake of the same advantage.&nbsp;
The total number of <i>persons</i> thus relieved will obviously
far exceed that of the aggregate of <i>Offices</i>.&nbsp; And who
will say that these great benefits, <i>the direct and principal
</i><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span><i>object</i> (be it remembered) <i>of the whole
measure</i>, are utterly vitiated by their unavoidable
accompaniment&mdash;the employment, namely, of a small
<i>additional</i> force in <i>one</i>, the Metropolitan Office,
on the same day?</p>
<p>What, then, remains, to justify the agitation occasioned by
this measure, but a vague and indefinite suspicion that a change
in one direction may lead to a change in the other? that a
measure which proposes neither to bring in nor take out a single
London letter on the Sunday, <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> may eventually
cause, in London itself, both a Sunday collection and a Sunday
delivery? that he who now seeks to lighten Sunday labour, to
diminish Sunday deliveries, Sunday letter-writing and
letter-reading, may hereafter lend his aid to their augmentation
and diffusion?&nbsp; Let these evils be met, on their proper
ground, and at the proper time.&nbsp; Let the good sense and the
religious feeling of the country be appealed to when the danger
really threatens.&nbsp; At present, it is as remote as
ever.&nbsp; It will not be brought <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>one step nearer by <i>this</i>
measure.&nbsp; But it <i>may</i> be increased by a premature and
unreasonable outcry, to be succeeded, as usual, by a very natural
recoil.</p>

&ldquo;I beg to submit my views as to further measures for
reducing the Sunday duties of the Post Office.&nbsp; The
importance of affording to all connected with the Post Office the
utmost amount of rest on the Sunday that is consistent with a due
regard to public convenience, having led to measures for the
suspension of money-order business on that day throughout England
and Wales, it is very satisfactory to remark, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; And I confidently anticipate like satisfactory
results, should the Treasury concur in your Lordship&rsquo;s
recent recommendation of a similar measure in Ireland and
Scotland . . .&nbsp; In considering the above improvement, the
importance of similar relief as respects other duties was kept in
mind; and, from the investigations which have been made, there
can be no doubt that a further very important relief as relates
to Sunday work may be effected in all the provincial
offices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote6a"></a><a href="#citation6a"
class="footnote">[6a]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 25.</p>

class="footnote">[8a]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 17.</p>
<p><a name="footnote8b"></a><a href="#citation8b"
class="footnote">[8b]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 12, 13.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even
to London [under the old system] nearly all letters from Ireland,
Scotland, and the out-ports, as also all foreign and colonial
letters whatever, are brought, as on other days; the same being
partly assorted at the chief office on the Sunday, for delivery
or for forwarding, as the case may be, the next morning.&nbsp;
For the performance of these duties, and for the selection and
delivery of the &lsquo;States&rsquo; (letters addressed chiefly
to the higher offices of Government), twenty-six persons are
ordinarily employed at the chief office on the Sunday, their time
of occupation being, on the average, six hours.&nbsp; The arrival
of a heavy mail from abroad requires a greater force.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote10"></a><a href="#citation10"
class="footnote">[10]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;The evil
of detention has been found so serious, that in several cases the
rule has been evaded, either by making use of other existing
channels for the conveyance of the mails sent on ordinary days
through London, or by the actual establishment of Sunday
cross-posts; either of which arrangements obviously involves
increased expence, trouble, liability to error, perplexity to the
public, <i>and additional Sunday work</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote11a"></a><a href="#citation11a"
class="footnote">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 14, 33.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11b"></a><a href="#citation11b"
class="footnote">[11b]</a>&nbsp; Minute, 21, 22, 23.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is notorious that a blank post is everywhere preceded
and followed by a greater amount of correspondence than
usual.&nbsp; Thus, in London, the average number of letters is
greater on Saturday by 6 per cent., and on Monday by 25 per
cent., than on other days.&nbsp; But, as respects the
correspondence sent through London, Saturday evening is at
present in most towns a blank post time.&nbsp; It therefore
follows that such correspondence is despatched from the provinces
in unusual amount on Saturday morning, and on Sunday morning or
evening, according as there may or may not be a Sunday day
mail.&nbsp; Now each of these augmentations tends to produce
additional Sunday work, both to the department and to the
public.&nbsp; For the letters in the first category are for the
most part distributed by the Post Office and read by the public
on the Sunday, and those in the second are for the most part
written by the public and despatched by the office on
Sunday.&nbsp; It is obvious therefore that, as far as relates to
the letters in question, the proposed change would entirely get
rid of Sunday work, as respects the public; while, as respects
the department, it would exchange work now dispersed through
nearly a thousand offices for concentrated employment in one; the
latter requiring a less proportionate force, and falling on such
time as to be dealt with without infringement on the hours of
divine service.&rdquo;</p>

<i>connection</i> of this measure with that now under
consideration is more fully illustrated.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
